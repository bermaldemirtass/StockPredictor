# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Predictor

This project demonstrates how to apply Linear Regression and LSTM models to predict Apple (AAPL) stock prices using historical data and engineered features.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `get_data.py` â€“ Downloads or prepares the dataset (e.g., aapl.csv)
- `feature_engineering.py` â€“ Adds lag features, moving averages, and volatility
- `model_linear.py` â€“ Linear Regression model
- `model_lstm.py` â€“ Basic LSTM model
- `model_lstm_advanced.py` â€“ Improved LSTM model (with more tuning)
- `visualize_results.py` â€“ Plots comparison between actual vs predicted prices

## ðŸ“Š Example Output

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

> This project is educational and aims to explore stock price modeling, not to be used as a financial forecasting tool.
